              <h3>YOUR DELIGHT ON A OLD PAPER </h3>
              I woke up this morning just to realized i had spent the better part of my 6 months trusting the one person I never should have met. It started like a beautiful bliss that was honey combed in eyes of all that cared to notice and many did notice. She was my Bambi, my pure delight and the only reason I can even go hiking. With her it was like i was life surfing but i should hve known better cos it was indeed too perfect to have true essence in reality. I was always the play boy and i had sworn to be true to never give in to the emotions of true loce and all its entangling packages, in short i was a User. i should have known because it always seemed like i was restrained resources. She changed my insane Obsession and she became my obsession. This is my conversation with dairy, a lonely heart shattered in Nano-bits. Is this the feeling? The feeling of heart break? On the contrary, I feel nothing and thats the problem. I out cold cos the User that i was indeed being used. The sysytem Administrator had me just where he wanted me... LoL... You thought i was talking about my Love life right? Yea me too...
